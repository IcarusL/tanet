Experiment reproduction for paper TANet: Towards Fully Automatic Tooth Arrangement.

  We reproduced the method proposed in TANet: Towards Fully Automatic Tooth Arrangement and test it on our malocclusion dataset. But the designed ggnn does not converge. We've looked up the details of the method within our capabilities but still don't know why. So I am writting to ask for some possible support.
